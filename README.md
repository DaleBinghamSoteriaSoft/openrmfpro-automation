## How this Repo is Organized

The Data for checklists, SCAP scans and Nessus/ACAS scans is in the data directory. Your scripts can pull from that sample data as examples. 

Each type of technology / language is organized in its own folder for dotnet core, golang, python, and scripts to just show examples. Your folder structure, URL, key, token, systemKey for data will be different but similar.
