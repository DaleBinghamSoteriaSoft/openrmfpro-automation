# Example Code for Python 3.x to push and pull data from OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional

## Install Requests

You will need to run `pip3 install requests` in order to load that library into your folder. Then you can start with the authentication.py script.

## Testing Authentication

To ensure your authentication is valid you can run `python3 authentication.py` and make sure it prints back 200 as the request status. If so then your API call, structure, API Key, Token and user/pwd combination for that API are all valid.

## API Calls

The API calls here follow the OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional Developer's Guide. Please contact <a href="https://www.soteriasoft.com/contact.html#contactform">Soteria Software</a> for more information.

## Notes
* for the Download XLSX scripts, there needs to be a ./download/ directory created where you run it. Or modify as appropriate.
