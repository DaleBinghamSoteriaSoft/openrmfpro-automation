# Dashboards

This is an area to expand OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional as far as pulling data from APIs and displaying on dashboards.

Most of the Dashboards here are Grafana and use the JSON API data source for Grafana at https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/. You can add that plugin, reset Grafana, and then use that data source to point to an OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional API.
