# System Package Status Dashboard

Using the “List System Packages” and then the “System Package Record” you could have a web page or dashboard that showed all system packages. Select one and it can show you the title, status, last update, patch score, checklist score, and other pertinent data on your system package. This would allow teams, “C” level personnel, and other groups to get high level data on your system package in real time.

Tie this into a Grafana dashboard to show the high level checklist score, patch score, and even the POAM risk cube and set it to auto update as well. 

You can check out the <a href="../dashboards">dashboards</a> area in this repo for examples and the JSON API plugin for OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional as a data source for this.
