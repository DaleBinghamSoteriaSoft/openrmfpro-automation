# Stale Checklist Data

Using the checklist listing for a system package in OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional, you can check the last updated date and see how old the information is within your system package. For those older checklists you can run a SCAP scan (using your own software or scripts) and then automatically upload and update your checklist data based on that scan. 

For a manual checklist, it can show you which have to be reviewed manually as well.
