# Missing Checklist or Patch Scan data

Using the hardware device listing for a system package in OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional, you can see which device has or does not have at least one patch scan and one checklist. Based on missing data, you can run those patch scans or SCAP scans / manual checklists to upload into your system package to show all the proper information across your system package. 

If you have automated ways to trigger scans then your routine can do that as well and then upload the results via our other APIs as well.
