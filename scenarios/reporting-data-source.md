# Reporting Data Sources

You can use the OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional APIs for data sources as well for your custom reporting applications, exporting data to other applications (ELK, Splunk) for your larger corporate or agency needs, as well as linking this to reporting applications like Qlik and other Business Intelligence tools. 

Run reports on the latest scores, checklists, hardware listing, ports and protocols, etc. to quickly gain access to data from your favorite reporting application or service.
