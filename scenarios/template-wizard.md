# Template Wizard Automation

Using the Template Listing API, Template Record API, and Bulk Add API you could create a web page wizard that asks the user/customer questions such as these:

* The technology their system package requires
* The device names / host names of servers for that technology
* If they have certain routers or firewalls
* Their database technology stack
* Any custom applications and the name / device for them

Using the information from this you could search the Templates, find the Templates based on a search of the type, get all the Template IDs, and then do a bulk add into the System Package desired to get starter checklists created from Custom, DISA or Organization Templates you have in your system. 

You also could add in the "hostname" so the checklist has the proper hostname and the hardware device listing will start to populate as well.
