The risk-based approach to control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations. Managing organizational risk is paramount to effective information security and privacy programs; the RMF approach can be applied to new and legacy systems, any type of system or technology (e.g., IoT, control systems), and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.",

It provides a standardized way for these governments to assess and authorize the security of cloud service providers (CSPs) before they work with sensitive information. This helps ensure that CSPs meet specific security standards, improves security for government data, and streamlines the process of vendor approval.",
