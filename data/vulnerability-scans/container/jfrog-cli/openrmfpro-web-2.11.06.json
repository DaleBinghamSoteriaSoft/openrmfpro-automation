          "full_description": "OpenSSL is an open-source cryptographic library and toolset that provides a wide range of protocol supported and functions for secure communication, data encryption, digital certificates, and other cryptographic operations, widely used in various software applications and systems.\nIn OpenSSL, the `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` verification mode is used to enforce the verification of the remote server's SSL/TLS certificate during the handshake process of a secure connection. When this mode is set, the client (or server, depending on the context) will check the validity of the presented certificate against a criteria set.\n\nRaw public keys (RPK) are a cryptographic method in public key infrastructure (PKI) that represent a public key without a digital certificate. Unlike certificates, which include extra details like identity and expiration, raw public keys are simpler and more efficient, making them ideal for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn OpenSSL, connections made using TLS and DTLS with RPKs may allow attackers to man-in-the-middle if clients fail to recognize a failure in server authentication. The problem only emerges when TLS clients deliberately activate RPK usage for the server, which in turn chooses to transmit an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The clients that are impacted are those that expect the handshake to fail if the server’s RPK does not align with one of the anticipated public keys, as determined by setting the verification mode to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.\n\nClients that enable server-side RPKs can still find out that RPK verification failed by calling the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function. If this check is made right after the handshake, clients can abort the communication in the proper cases and therefore will not be vulnerable.\n\nNote: By default, RPKs are turned off in both TLS clients and servers.",
