In XZ Utils 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0, the multithreaded .xz decoder in liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a crash. The effects include heap use after free and writing to an address based on the null pointer plus an offset. Applications and libraries that use the lzma_stream_decoder_mt function are affected. The bug has been fixed in XZ Utils 5.8.1, and the fix has been committed to the v5.4, v5.6, v5.8, and master branches in the xz Git repository. No new release packages will be made from the old stable branches, but a standalone patch is available that applies to all affected releases.",

If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.",

          "full_description": "OpenSSL is an open-source cryptographic library and toolset that provides a wide range of protocol supported and functions for secure communication, data encryption, digital certificates, and other cryptographic operations, widely used in various software applications and systems.\nIn OpenSSL, the `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` verification mode is used to enforce the verification of the remote server's SSL/TLS certificate during the handshake process of a secure connection. When this mode is set, the client (or server, depending on the context) will check the validity of the presented certificate against a criteria set.\n\nRaw public keys (RPK) are a cryptographic method in public key infrastructure (PKI) that represent a public key without a digital certificate. Unlike certificates, which include extra details like identity and expiration, raw public keys are simpler and more efficient, making them ideal for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn OpenSSL, connections made using TLS and DTLS with RPKs may allow attackers to man-in-the-middle if clients fail to recognize a failure in server authentication. The problem only emerges when TLS clients deliberately activate RPK usage for the server, which in turn chooses to transmit an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The clients that are impacted are those that expect the handshake to fail if the server’s RPK does not align with one of the anticipated public keys, as determined by setting the verification mode to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.\n\nClients that enable server-side RPKs can still find out that RPK verification failed by calling the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function. If this check is made right after the handshake, clients can abort the communication in the proper cases and therefore will not be vulnerable.\n\nNote: By default, RPKs are turned off in both TLS clients and servers.",

However, measuring\nthe timing would require either local access to the signing application or\na very fast network connection with low latency.\n\nThere is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of\nthe inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant\nprobability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular\nthe NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker\nprocess must either be located in the same physical computer or must\nhave a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.",
