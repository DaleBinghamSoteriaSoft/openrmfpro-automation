This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended.",

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding. The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions. Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot easily be ruled out. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency. There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low. The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.",
