The organization develops and documents a risk assessment policy.,medium,"Check that the organization has developed a documented risk assessment policy and procedures to carry out that policy. Ensure that it addresses all issues required in the discussion and this information is readily available to all roles of personnel required in the organization. Also ensure this information is reviewed per the required frequency documented by the organization.

If any of this is not done, this is a finding.",Create a risk assessment policy and procedures to carry out that policy and document all aspects of that. Ensure that it addresses all issues required in the discussion and this information is readily available to all roles of personnel required in the organization. Make sure it is reviewed and that required frequency is documented by the organization.,"The organization develops and documents a risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

The organization disseminates a risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance to organization-defined defined personnel or roles.

The organization develops, documents and disseminates procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and associated risk assessment controls to defined personnel or roles.

The organization reviews and updates the current risk assessment policy and procedures in accordance with a defined organization-defined frequency.","CCI-001037, CCI-001038, CCI-002368"
The organization conducts an assessment of risk of the information system.,low,"Check that the organization has done or is going to do a risk assessment and document the information accordingly. Ensure the results are put into a predefined plan or report and sent to all required personnel. And there are definitions on the frequency for updated risk assessments required based on time, changes, or other conditions laid out.

If any of this is not done, this is a finding.",Conduct a risk assessment for the IS and document it in the correct plan or report. Then review it with all required personnel after they receive the report or plan and review it. Update the risk assessment when required and document the updated results again in the required document and disseminate appropriately.,"The organization conducts an assessment of risk of the information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits that includes the likelihood and magnitude of harm from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
The organization defines the organizational document in which risk assessment results are documented (e.g., security plan, risk assessment report) and documents risk assessment results in the organization-defined document.

The organization reviews risk assessment results on an organization-defined defined frequency and disseminates risk assessment results to organization-defined personnel or roles.

The organization updates the risk assessment on an organization-defined frequency or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.","CCI-001053, CCI-001052, CCI-001051, CCI-001050"
The organization defines the process for conducting random vulnerability scans on the information system (IS).	,high,"Check that the organization defines a process for conducting vulnerability scans on IS and hosted applications with a specific frequency. Ensure scans are conducted when new vulnerabilities possibly affecting the IS are identified and reported. And that they use correct and relevant vulnerability scanning tools across OS, process, procedure, software and configuration where appropriate and applicable and measure their impact.

The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications in accordance with the organization-defined process for random scans in an organization-defined frequency.

The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported.

The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for: enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; formatting checklists and test procedures; and measuring vulnerability impact.

The organization analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments.

The organization remediates legitimate vulnerabilities in organization-defined response times in accordance with an organizational assessment risk and defines response times for remediating legitimate vulnerabilities.

The organization shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).",CCI-001641
