TLS is a protocol for protecting communications between the browser and the target server. When the browser attempts to set up a protected communication with the target server, the browser and server negotiate which protocol and version to use. The browser and server attempt to match each other's list of supported protocols and versions and pick the most preferred match.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000514, SRG-APP-000555, SRG-APP-000625, SRG-APP-000630, SRG-APP-000635","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-59337","V-46473"],"ccis":["CCI-002450"],"reference_identifier":"4095","uuid":"56b95ecd-18a1-4f10-a69c-b85811965988","stig_uuid":"06748cda-c64f-4854-aa03-b2ca00be660f","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2501.0 (Scan-IE11_Checks) found this to be OPEN on 04/09/2025:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n'Turn off Encryption Support' is NOT Enabled: (Use TLS1.1, Use TLS 1.2)\n\nRegistry Path:HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\nValue Name:SecureProtocols\nValue:0x00000a00 (2560) [Expected 800]\nType:REG_DWORD\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-250541","group_tree":[{"id":"V-250541","title":"SRG-APP-000416","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-250541","severity":"medium","group_title":"Allow Fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer) must be disabled.","rule_id_src":"SV-250541r942485_rule","rule_id":"SV-250541r942485","rule_version":"DTBI1100-IE11","rule_title":"Allow Fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer) must be disabled.","fix_text":"Set the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Internet Explorer >> Security Features >> \"Allow fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer)\" to \"Enabled\", and select \"No Sites\" from the drop-down box.\n","weight":"10.0","check_content":"The policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Internet Explorer >> Security Features >> \"Allow fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer)\" must be \"Enabled\", and \"No Sites\" selected from the drop-down box.

New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible.\r\n\r\n.NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process. Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity.\r\n\r\nNormally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource.

Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. \n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). \n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update.
